Why use the hosted version?
---------------------------

### Everything is managed for you

You don't have to worry about technical details: server administration, security updates, SSL certificates, domain names, backups, monitoring, etc.

### Automatic updates and backups

The hosted version of Kanboard uses the latest open source stable version.
Official plugins are updated for you.
Daily backup of your data is made automatically for you.

### No vendor lock-in

The hosted version is fully compatible with the open source version. 
You can ask for a copy of your data at any time and use it without any modifications (we use Postgresql).

### Secure connection

You can access to Kanboard by HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate.

### Sustainable business model and privacy

If you're not paying for it, you're the product.
There are no ads, no user tracking, no spam, no marketing.
We are small and independent, not a large scale business.

### Human customer support

You can talk directly by email to the developers, real humans, not another outsourced customer support.
We can communicate in English or in French.
