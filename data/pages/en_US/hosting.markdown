Why use the hosted version?
---------------------------

### Everything is managed for you

You don't have to worry about technical details: server administration, security updates, SSL certificates, domain names, backups, monitoring, etc.

### Automatic updates and backups

The hosted version of Kanboard uses the latest stable version.
Official plugins are updated for you.
A daily backup of your data is made automatically for you.

### No vendor lock-in

The hosted version is exactly the same version as the open source version.

You can ask for a copy of your data at any time and use it without any modifications (we use PostgreSQL).

### Secure connection

You can access to Kanboard by HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate.

### Sustainable business model

If you're not paying for it, you're the product.

We are small and independent, not a large scale business.

### Kanboard does not collect or share personal information

There is no ads, no user tracking or spam.

We respect the privacy of our users.

### Human customer support

You can talk directly by email to the developers, real humans, not another outsourced customer support.
We can communicate in English or in French.

### Where are located the servers?

The infrastructure and data are located in New York, USA.
