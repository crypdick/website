Why use the hosted version?
---------------------------

### Everything is managed for you

You don't have to worry about technical details: server administration, security updates, SSL certificates, domain names, backups, monitoring, etc...

### Your own private instance

Each customer has its own instance of Kanboard running inside a container and its own database.
In this way, you can install any plugins available from the directory.

### Automatic updates and backups

The hosted version of Kanboard use the latest open source stable version.
Official plugins are updated for you.
Daily backup of your data is made automatically for you.

### No vendor lock-in

The hosted version is fully compatible with the open source version. 
You can ask for a copy of your data at any time and use it without any modifications.

### Secure connection

You can access to Kanboard by HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate.

### Sustainable business model

If you're not paying for it, you're the product.
There is no ads, no user tracking, no spam, no marketing.
We are small, not a large scale business.

### Human customer support

You can talk directly by email to the developers, real humans, not another outsourced customer support.
We can communicate in English or in French.
